## Motivation
In an ambitious attempt to improve the quality of life of Singaporeans while they are overseas (either for short term or long term), whatsHappeningSia is an interactive app which allows overseas Singaporeans to connect over their favourite activities, and be reminded of Singaporean slang in a place where Singlish isn't used.

## Feature 1: Singlishfy
- If you miss Singaporean slang, feel free to have a go at our chatbot and be reminded of so-singaporean words.
- Development: Key in a casual article and get your news article singlish-fied! See `singlisfy_algo` for the python script and test it out yourself!
