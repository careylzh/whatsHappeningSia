## Motivation
In an ambitious attempt to improve the quality of life of Singaporeans while they are overseas (either for short term or long term), whatsHappeningSia is an interactive app which allows overseas Singaporeans to connect over their favourite activities, and be reminded of Singaporean slang in a place where Singlish isn't used.

Singaporeans overseas can easily feel a sense of disconnection to Singapore as they are busy with studying or working. According to a survey we conducted, 100% felt homesick, 80% doesn't feel the same being back home, 60% experienced a culture shock and 50% were unable to find help catered to their community. Furthermore, 70% attempted to look for a Singaporean friend overseas, but only 1 person succeeded. 

The survey results brings across a glaring issue - **Singaporeans overseas are unable to find fellow Singaporeans in their community who can offer personal support that they need.**

Our application will connect overseas Singaporeans together, and help them form connections based on common interests. At the same time, the chatting function on our website gives users the option of 'Singlish-fying' their messages before sending it out, further reinforcing their Singaporean identity. Our news feed page also updates them on latest news in Singapore. 

## Feature 1: Singlishfy
- If you miss Singaporean slang, feel free to have a go at our chatbot and be reminded of so-singaporean words.
- Development: Key in a casual article and get your news article singlish-fied! See `singlisfy_algo` for the python script and test it out yourself!
